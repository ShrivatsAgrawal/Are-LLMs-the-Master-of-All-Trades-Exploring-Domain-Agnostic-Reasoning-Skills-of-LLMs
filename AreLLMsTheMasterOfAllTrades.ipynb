However, the reasoning abilities of humans are multifaceted and can be seen in various forms, including analogical, spatial, causal and moral reasoning, among others. This fact raises the question whether LLMs can perform equally well across all these different domains. This research work aims to investigate the performance of LLMs on different reasoning tasks by conducting experiments that directly use or draw inspirations from existing datasets on analogical and spatial reasoning. Additionally, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reason like human, I evaluate their performance on more open-ended, natural language questions for analogical, spatial and moral reasoning. My findings indicate that LLMs excel at analogical and moral reasoning, yet struggle to perform as proficiently on spatial reasoning tasks. I believe these experiments are crucial for informing the future development and practical development of LLMs, particularly in contexts that require diverse reasoning proficiencies. By shedding light on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, this study aims to push forward our understanding of how they can better emulate the cognitive abilities of humans."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BqPYW3PZNFSr"},"source":["## Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":39509,"status":"ok","timestamp":1677272095251,"user":{"displayName":"Shrivats Agrawal","userId":"09754059988330302552"},"user_tz":300},"id":"PW5rG40iNYhv"},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","!pip install openai"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":320,"status":"ok","timestamp":1677272095566,"user":{"displayName":"Shrivats Agrawal","userId":"09754059988330302552"},"user_tz":300},"id":"J3EGFEQSNL29"},"outputs":[],"source":["import openai\n","import os\n","import re\n","import random\n","from copy import copy\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import pandas as pd\n","import time\n","random.seed(42)\n","\n","#Insert OpenAI API key here\n","openai.api_key = input(\"Enter OpenAI API key.\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fDaWZDhkQ8Tp"},"source":["## Helper Functions"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2,"status":"ok","timestamp":1677272095566,"user":{"displayName":"Shrivats Agrawal","userId":"09754059988330302552"},"user_tz":300},"id":"nCqC7byrNM2u"},"outputs":[],"source":["from os import replace\n","def gpt3_call(gpt3_type, prompt):\n","    response = openai.Completion.create(\n","                    engine=gpt3_type,\n","                    prompt=prompt,\n","                    temperature=0.4,\n","                    max_tokens=256,\n","                    top_p=1,\n","                    logprobs=1,\n","                    frequency_penalty=0,\n","                    presence_penalty=0\n","                )\n","    return response\n","\n","def response2text(response):\n","  return response['choices'][0]['text']\n","\n","def format_response(text):\n","  replacements = ['\\n',\".\"]\n","  for replacement in replacements:\n","    text = text.replace(replacement, \"\")\n","  return text\n","\n","gpt3_type = \"text-davinci-003\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cs-9fG2IQ_ds"},"source":["#### Mount Drive and define paths"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2,"status":"ok","timestamp":1677272095566,"user":{"displayName":"Shrivats Agrawal","userId":"09754059988330302552"},"user_tz":300},"id":"33SAB9OJRCjB"},"outputs":[],"source":["project_path = \"/\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LpnTLOxxON0o"},"source":["# Reasoning:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sOGBcUV_OKRh"},"source":["## 1.
